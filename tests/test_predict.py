That nation is The Netherlands.The satire show Zondag Met Lubach, much like our own The Daily Show, put together a fake tourism commercial using a voice that sounded just like Trump s, and using language that he would use, including some policy proposals.Needless to say, they re not huge fans of Trump whatsoever.Dutch comedian Arjen Lubach says, as he introduces the pretend advertisement: He had a clear message to the rest of the world:  I will screw you over big time.  Well okay, he used slightly different words:  From this day forward. It s going to be only America first .And we realize it s better for us to get along [so] we decided to introduce our tiny country to him in a way that will probably appeal to him the most. From there, it was absolutely comic genius.Watch the hilarious video here:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video"
