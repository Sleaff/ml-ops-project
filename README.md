## Goal of the project

The goal for this project is to learn the frameworks around ML-ops. Our group consists of students with extensive experience with machine learning, but not too much with the framework around it. We are all inexperienced with using the tools proposed in the course so the goal for our group would be to implement as much of the tools from the course as possible into the project so we can see which tools we like and would want to work with later. Moreover we also want to get used to working in a collaborative manner where we can document, view and understand the changes the others make.

## The Data

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

We propse a project to classify news. We have identified a dataset which includes two types of classes. One with fake news and one with true news. The dataset is mostly pure text but also includes other features such as the type of news and the date the text was published. The dataset includes 17903 unqiue datapoints. 

## The models

For the model we will try to use a BERT model. BERT is a language model from google which only uses the encoder part of a transformer architecture. We expect the model to do well on the task after we fine tune since it had a huge impact on the NLP field when it came out.
